# copier-pyproject

Copier template for a modern, typed Python package/CLI with `uv`, `hatch`, `tox`, and GitHub automation baked in.

## What this template includes

- uv-first workflow with dependency groups (dev, style, test, docs, tool, pre-commit) and tox-uv runners across Python 3.10–3.14; builds via `hatchling`/`hatch-vcs` with versions from Git tags.
- Ready-to-run Typer CLI entrypoint, FastAPI app stub, logging/config modules, type hints, and a `py.typed` marker plus CLI/web tests; container-ready `Dockerfile`.
- QA stack: pytest with coverage/xdist/reruns (and `.codecov.yml`), ruff, mypy, pyright, ty, pyrefly, vulture, slotscheck, taplo, validate-pyproject, typos, actionlint.
- Docs and site: MkDocs scaffold (`docs/index.md`) with GitHub Pages deploy workflow.
- Automation and hygiene: CI/CD workflows (matrix tests, trusted-publishing to PyPI, gh-pages), release drafter, release-please config, PR title linting, issue/PR templates, Renovate config, Commitizen, pre-commit (with pre-commit-uv), devcontainer, VS Code launch config, gitignore, FUNDING, and LICENSE.
- Extra tooling: Trunk config (hadolint/markdownlint/etc.), Pants config, `.dockerignore`, and badge-rich README template for generated projects.

## Inputs

Copier will prompt for:

- `github_user`
- `github_repo_name` (lowercase letters/digits/dashes, starts with a letter)
- `author_full_name`
- `author_email`
- `short_description`

## Scaffold a project

1. Install Copier and uv (e.g., `uvx copier`).
2. Run `copier copy gh:hasansezertasan/copier-pyproject <destination>` (or `copier copy . <destination>` from a local clone).
3. Optionally seed answers with `.example-input.yml` using `--data-file .example-input.yml --defaults`.
4. Open the generated README (rendered from `template/README.md.jinja`) and clear the `TODO @...` markers in `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, docs, and workflows.

## Generated project quickstart

- Install dependencies: `uv sync`
- Style gate: `uv run --locked tox run -e style`
- Full test suite: `uv run --locked tox run`
- Run the CLI: `uv run --locked <repo-name> version`
- Run the FastAPI app: `uv run --locked fastapi dev <repo-name>.app:app`
- Serve docs locally: `uv run --only-group docs mkdocs serve` (deploys via GitHub Pages on release)
- Optional tooling: `trunk check` for aggregated linting; `pants lint ::` for Pants-based linting.

`example/README.md` shows the rendered README produced from `.example-input.yml`.

## Release automation

Publishing a GitHub release triggers `.github/workflows/cd.yml.jinja` to build with uv and push to PyPI using trusted publishing. Docs deploy from releases via `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`, and CI runs on macOS/Linux/Windows via `.github/workflows/ci.yml.jinja`.

If you prefer release PRs or manual bumping, `release-please-config.json` and `.release-it.json` are provided alongside release-drafter.

### PyPI Trusted Publishing setup

Enable PyPI once per project for `.github/workflows/cd.yml`:

1. Open [Trusted Publisher Management](https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/).
2. Under "Add a new pending publisher", pick "GitHub".
3. Set `PyPI Project Name` to your package name.
4. Set `Owner` to your GitHub username.
5. Set `Repository name` to your repo name.
6. Set `Workflow name` to `cd.yml` (or your workflow filename).
7. Set `Environment name` to `publish` (or your chosen env).
8. Save.

### Release steps

1. Draft a GitHub Release (tag = version).
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version details.
3. Publish the release.
4. `cd.yml` will build the wheel/sdist with uv, publish to PyPI via trusted publishing, and upload artifacts to the GitHub Release.
